Quarto is a powerful tool for creating dynamic documents that combine text, code, and data visualizations. For your assignments and worksheets, using Quarto will allow you to seamlessly integrate your analysis with your written explanations/comments, making your reports more cohesive and professional.

### Integrating Text and Code

Find the area of a circle with radius 5 cm.

Formula: ¶ \* r\^2

where r is the radius.

```{r}
# Function to calculate the area of a circle
area_of_circle <- function(radius) {
  area <- pi * radius^2
  return(area)
}
radius <- 5 # from the example
circle_area <- area_of_circle(radius)
cat("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", circle_area, "\n")
```

### 09/16/24 Worksheet 2 & 3

![1) Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a\
herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%. ](images/clipboard-2842199144.png)

A sample size of 59 deer is required to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence.

2\) Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the\
following scenarios:\
a) 95% confidence in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population

A sample size of 299 deer is required to detect a disease at or above 1% prevalence with a 95% confidence interval. \

b\) 99% confidence in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population

A sample size of 229 deer is required to detect a disease at or above 2% prevalence with a 99% confidence interval.

3\) You sample 300 deer from a high fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the\
300 have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you\
are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is \_\_\<\_\_\_ (\<, =,\
\>) \_\_1\_\_%.

4\) An outbreak of ‘Lame disease’ has been reported in wild turkey populations of\
Alabama. Turkeys from three counties were sampled for lameness (Lee, Chambers and\
Russell counties).\
a) Analyze the sample data to determine prevalence of lameness in each county.\
Provide confidence interval for prevalence using Sterne’s method.

Chambers: Lower CL = 0.131, Upper CL = 0.449

Lee: Lower CL = 0.143, Upper CL = 0.273

Russell: Lower CL = 0.009, Upper CL = 0.087

\
b) Compare prevalences using Fisher’s exact test.

Chambers: 26.7%

Lee: 20.0%

Russell: 3.1%

Chambers County has the highest prevalence of lameness while Russell County has the least.

5\) Jane was studying the spread of Pink Spot Disease (PSD) in a pond that had 60 fish.\
She introduced an infectious fish in the pond on day 0. Her observations are as follows:\
Day 1: 3 fish infected\
Day 2: 4 fish infected\
Day 3: 7 fish infected\
Day 4: 11 fish infected\
Day 5: 20 fish infected\
Note that there is no disease-related mortality. The observations denote all infected fish\
in the pond (including previously infected fish).\

a\) Find incidence on day 1, day 2 and day 5. Write the unit for incidence.\
Day 1: 3 fish/day

Day 2: 1 fish/day

Day 5: 9 fish/day

b\) What is the prevalence of PSD on day 3 and day 5?\
Day 3: (7/60)\*100 = 11.67%

Day 5: (20/60)\*100 = 33.33%

c\) On which day is the prevalence same as the incidence (except the units)?\
Day 1 is when prevalence is the same as incidence (=3).
